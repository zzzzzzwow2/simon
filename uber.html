          <p >
            In 2012, tapping a button to Uber across the city<br />felt magical.
            By the start of 2016, this magic<br />receded to a slew of disparate
            features that made<br />the experience slow and complex to use.
          </p>
          <p >
            I was part of an ambitious project to redesign the Uber pickup<br />experience
            for the fastest growing startup in history.

          <h2 class="title"> Design by accretion</h2>
          <p>In just five years since 2011, Uber transformed from a black car service for 100 friends in San Francisco to a global transportation network. By 2016, Uber delivered over 3 million rides a day in over 400 cities across 70 countries.</p>
          <p>The Rider app — designed in 2012, struggled to scale alongside the hyper-growth of the company. Fundamental usability was challenged. Disparate features and experiments competed for focus. App reliability and performance issues increased exponentially.</p>
          <p>The Rider app had become the org chart.</p>

          <h3 class="title group">Recapture the Magic in 10 Months</h3>
          <p>Our goal for the project was to recapture the magic of the early days of Uber. The original premise was simple: tap a button, get a ride. However, we weren't trying to revert to a simple past. Our ambitions were to create a strong foundation that embraced a rapidly evolving business and more diverse user base.</p>
          <h3 class="list group">Our high level goals were to:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Make it fast and easy to use for everyone, everywhere.</li>
            <li>Give riders more control over their time and money.</li>
            <li>Create a platform for innovation and deeper engagement.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class="title medium">My Role</h3>
          <p>I led the design of the pickup experience between October 2015 and June 2016 and collaborated with two other designers on the Home screen, Search and On Trip features.</p>
          <p>In addition, I worked alongside a Researcher, Prototyper, Content Strategist and 2 Product Managers.





          </p>
          <p>I stopped working on the project during the detailed visual design phase as the app started to be built.</p>
          <p>The app launched globally on November 2nd, 2016.</p>
